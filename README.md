## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Supabase Configuration

1. **Create a new Supabase project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

2. **Run the database migrations** (SQL commands to create tables):

```sql
-- Create profiles table
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  voice_level INTEGER DEFAULT 10,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create issues table
CREATE TABLE issues (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  poverty_types TEXT[] NOT NULL,
  country TEXT NOT NULL,
  province TEXT NOT NULL,
  city TEXT NOT NULL,
  ngo TEXT,
  author_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create comments table
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  issue_id UUID REFERENCES issues(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  author_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE issues ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE comments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can read all profiles" ON profiles FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read issues" ON issues FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create issues" ON issues FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own issues" ON issues FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = author_id);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read comments" ON comments FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create comments" ON comments FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own comments" ON comments FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = author_id);
```

3. **Configure authentication** in Supabase dashboard:
   - Enable email/password authentication
   - Disable email confirmation for development
   - Set up redirect URLs

## üöÄ Deployment

### Netlify Deployment

This project is configured for seamless deployment on Netlify.

#### Build Issues Fixed

During the deployment process, we addressed several issues:

1. **Cross-Platform Build Commands**
   - Added cross-env for consistent environment variable handling across platforms
   - Updated build script to prevent CI failures on warnings: `"build": "cross-env CI=false vite build"`

2. **ESLint Configuration**
   - Installed missing TypeScript ESLint dependencies
   - Fixed ESLint configuration import paths

3. **Proper Redirects for SPA**
   - Added Netlify configuration to handle client-side routing

#### Deployment Options

##### Option 1: Continuous Deployment (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
4. Deploy!

##### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Build your project locally: `npm run build`
2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder to Netlify's dashboard
3. Your site will be live in seconds

##### Option 3: Netlify CLI Deployment

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli
